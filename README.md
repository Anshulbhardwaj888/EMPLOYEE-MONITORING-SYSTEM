# EMPLOYEE-MONITORING-SYSTEM
In many companies now-a-days data security and data recovery is the most important factor.  So there are many cases where data security and recovery is required. For these kinds of problems Remote Employee Monitoring System is one of the best solutions. This project is based on the technique called keystrokes capturing or keylogging. Remote Monitoring is the action of recording the keys stroke on a keyboard, Audio of the employee, frequent screenshots are taken, system information etc. So  that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. Using this keylogger based application we can easily monitor users all day activity and receive in on our email.  This is a surveillance application used to track the users which logs keystrokes; uses log files to retrieve information. Using this application we can recall forgotten email or URL. In this Remote Monitoring project, whenever the user types something through the keyboard, the keystrokes are captured and mailed to the mail id of admin without the knowledge of the user within the time set.
